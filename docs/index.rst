Small-Text
==========

`Small-Text` provides :doc:`active learning<active_learning>` for text classification.
It is designed to offer a robust and modular set of components *for both experimental and applied active learning*.

Why Small-Text?
===============

- **Interchangeable components**: All components are based around the `ActiveLearner <https://github.com/webis-de/small-text/blob/main/small_text/active_learner.py>`_ class.
  You can mix and match different many initialization strategies, query strategies, and classifiers.
- Integrations: Optional Integrations allow you to use **GPU-based models** from the pytorch and transformers libraries.
- **Common patterns**: We provide solutions to common challenges when building experiments and/or applications,
  such as :doc:`patterns/pool` and :doc:`patterns/serialization`.
- Multiple scientifically evaluated components are **pre-implemented and ready to use**
  (:doc:`query strategies<components/query_strategies>`, :doc:`initialization strategies<components/initialization>`, and :doc:`stopping criteria<components/stopping_criteria>`).
